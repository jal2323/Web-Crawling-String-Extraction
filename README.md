# Web-Crawling-String-Extraction

The motivation behind this script was to use the actual text of job postings to identify “green employers”. This was done in an effort to determine short-term job growth in environmentally friendly/green employment. 

This script scrapes the job posting content off of the website sustainablebusiness.com, extracts strings from the text, cleans the text, and provides a word count for the most commonly used words in “green” job postings.
